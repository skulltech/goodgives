# goodreads-giveaways
Auto enter giveaways in Goodreads.

## Installation and Set-up

Clone the repo and install the pre-reqs.
```console
git clone https://github.com/SkullTech/goodreads-giveaways.git
cd goodreads-giveaways
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

___Important___: Before running the script, make sure you've entered a giveaway manually _at least once_. The first time involves _setting up a new address_, and the script assumes that it's done. Also, if you have multiple addresses set-up, the script takes the first one. 

## Usage

Run the script from the terminall like the following example.

```console
~/Documents/goodreads-giveaways  master ✔                                0m  
▶ python3 giveaways.py
